                                <h3> Honeypots Introduction </h3>
                                <p>
                                    In todays world there are many cyberattackers living on the internet and Dark web ,from beginner to experts.
                                    All the systems which are deployed on the internet and scanned continuously by systems like "Shodan" and one can easily find the IP address and other details to find the system hosted on the internet,so the hackers come to you easily.
                                    Shodan is the search engine for Internet connected devices i.e it scans the ports on the internet and analyzes which services are running and then displays it on "https://www.shodan.io/".
                                    Here comes honeypots into play.
                                    Honeypots are traps which are set to detect attempts at any unauthorized use of computer systems,with a view to learning from the attacks to further improve computer security.
                                    Traditionally, one has to be still careful when using network based techniques like firewalls,intrusion detection systems and encryption.Nowadays,more advanced techniques like Honeypots are used, to get the knowledge about the hackers moves.
                                    The main purpose for honeypots is to detect and learn from the attacks and further use the information to improve security.<br>
                                    <h3>Why Honeypots? </h3>
                                    Most important usage of the honeypots is to monitor hackers moves in the system.As honeypots are just traps, the hacker would not be able to distinguish between a real system and a trap.
                                    The honeypots are designed in such a way that it would interact with the hacker and the hacker will never be able to distinguish between an honeypot trap and a real system.
                                    For example suppose an ssh server is setup in honeypot ,so it can be used to monitor the username and passwords what are used by the hackers while attacking an ssh server and then we can protect the actual sshd server running.
                                    <br>
                                    Honeypots also collect the data which are useful to analyze the hacker activity and be ready to learn the attackers moves.
                                    In an honeypot there are ideally various services setup which are commonly used in information systems like sshd,http ,etc and so it can be useful to study the attacks on these services as they are widely used in almost all information systems.
                                    Also honeypots are cost effective as it just interacts with the attackers and does not require high-performance resource.

                                    <h3> About the Honeypot Project </h3>
                                    This is a project which I am working on,this project is sponsored by Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
                                    OWASP Python Honeypot is an open source project in Python language which is designed for creating honeypot and honeynet in an easy and secure way. OWASP Honeypot is an open source software in Python language which designed for creating honeypot and honeynet in an easy and secure way!

                                    <h3> My Work in GSOC 2020 </h3>

                                    This is the second time I was selected for the same project, so this year it was the continuation of the work from GSOC 2019. It was more fun this time because I also worked with one more peer named Chakshu Gupta and we almost finished testing and all the bugs of the framework this GSOC and we would be releasing the first version of the framework soon.
                                    <h4> Refactor Core part of Framework </h4>

                                    The OWASP Python Honeypot has a core section and API section in the codebase. I was involved in refactoring of the core part of the framework. <br>
                                    <h4> Write Unit tests </h4>
                                    After refactoring the core part of the framework, the next task I was involved in was writing the unit tests of the core part. Previously, there were not tests written in the framework. <br>
                                    <h4> Fixing Bugs </h4>
                                    After the refactoring and tests were finished of the complete framework,( core part by me and API part by Chakshu Gupta) , then I worked on fixing some minor issues.<br>
                                    <h4> SMTP Module </h4>
                                    SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a standard language (protocol) used by all the applications to send emails. I added the SMTP module in the framework. <br>

                                    <h4> Logging </h4>
                                    There  was no logging of the events before GSOC 2020. I added logging of the events in the framework , previously the events data were just displayed on the terminal.  <br>

                                    I have completed most the tasks which were mentioned by me in the proposal.
                                    <br>
                                    I would like to thank my mentor <a href="https://github.com/Ali-Razmjoo" target="_blank"> Ali Razmjoo </a> for being an awesome mentor and also <a href="https://github.com/ChakshuGupta" target="_blank"> Chakshu Gupta (peer) </a>  for the constant feedback on my work done during GSOC.
                                    Had they not been so supportive, it would not have been a successful one.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Lastly, thank you Google for organizing such an awesome program.
