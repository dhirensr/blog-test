                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    In todays world there are many cyberattackers living on the internet and Dark web ,from beginner to experts.They are continuously searching for some systems to attack to and grab the data and make it publicly available.
                                    All the systems which are deployed on the internet and scanned continuously by systems like "Shodan" and one can easily find the IP address and other details to find the system hosted on the internet,so the hackers come to you easily.
                                    Shodan is the search engine for Internet connected devices i.e it scans the ports on the internet and analyzes which services are running and then displays it on "https://www.shodan.io/".
                                    Here comes honeypots into play.
                                    Honeypots are traps which are set to detect attempts at any unauthorized use of computer systems,with a view to learning from the attacks to further improve computer security.
                                    Traditionally, one has to be still careful when using network based techniques like firewalls,intrusion detection systems and encryption.Nowadays,more advanced techniques like Honeypots are used, to get the knowledge about the hackers moves.
                                    The main purpose for honeypots is to detect and learn from the attacks and further use the information to improve security.<br>
                                    <h3>Why Honeypots? </h3>
                                    Most important usage of the honeypots is to monitor hackers moves in the system.As honeypots are just traps, the hacker would not be able to distinguish between a real system and a trap.
                                    The honeypots are designed in such a way that it would interact with the hacker and the hacker will never be able to distinguish between an honeypot trap and a real system.
                                    For example suppose an ssh server is setup in honeypot ,so it can be used to monitor the username and passwords what are used by the hackers while attacking an ssh server and then we can protect the actual sshd server running.
                                    <br>

                                    Honeypots also collect the data which are useful to analyze the hacker activity and be ready to learn the attackers moves.
                                    In an honeypot there are ideally various services setup which are commonly used in information systems like sshd,http ,etc and so it can be useful to study the attacks on these services as they are widely used in almost all information systems.
                                    Also honeypots are cost effective as it just interacts with the attackers and does not require high-performance resource.

                                    <h3> About the Honeypot Project </h3>
                                    This is a project which I am working on,this project is sponsored by OWASP which is a big organization in the security field.
                                    OWASP Python Honeypot is an open source software in Python language which is designed for creating honeypot and honeynet in an easy and secure way.

                                    There are basically modules in this project and each of them has services in it: <br>
                                    1. SSHD server : when you deploy OWASP honeypot, it will deploy two docker containers each one of them with an sshd server running.The difference between them would be one of them has a weak password and the other one has a strong password.
                                    The weak password sshd server is used to monitor hacker activities like what commands does the hacker perform after getting logged in easily.
                                    The strong password sshd server is used to monitor what does hacker provides as username/passwords to get into the system.As the system has a randomly generated password , it would not be that easy to log in to the system .Also for each attempt to sshd login there are logs stored as to what is being used as username and password. <br>
                                    2. FTP server : There are two versions of this module namely weak password and strong password.
                                    The weak password is used to monitor what type of files /malware does the hacker upload once logged in easily to the system.The username and password is very easy to guess ,typically username as "root" and password as "123456" ,so the hacker can get in easily.
                                    The strong password is again used to monitor the username and password used to log in to the system and then also the type of file uploaded by the hacker.Each of these activities are logged in the docker container and on a timely basis sent to the database to store as a record.
                                    The database used in this project is MongoDB. <br>

                                    3. HTTP server : This module has also two versions of this module namely weak password and strong password.
                                    Weak passwords is used to monitor the requests on the server and also if the hacker is trying Denial of Service attacks it can be easily detected by this module.
                                    Strong passwords would again track the username and passwords used by the attacker to get into the system.
                                    <br>
