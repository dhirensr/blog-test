                                <h3 id="text&#95;retrieval&#95;(tr)">Text Retrieval (TR)</h3><p> I'm starting blogging and this is my first post.It's about text retrieval ,I used to wonder how do search engines work exactly,sometimes they even seem smarter than an actual human .Search engines for example understand a lot of complex queries and also filter the results very accurately. </br> So there are a lot of resources on internet and based on some algorithms they retrieve the text which are useful for the user. </br> There are two algorithms for text retrieval ,one is document selection in which based on an algorithm's result the most relevant document is returned to the user ,the other is document ranking in which an rank is given to the documents by an algorithm based on the query of the user. The user then has the choice to pick the most important/relevant document needed .That's why document ranking is more preferred over document selection. </br> There are many algorithms for choosing the most appropriate documents based on the search query of the user. </br>  Ranking of query results is the problem in text retrieval .Given a query Q and a collection of documents D that match the query the problem is to rank the documents in the most relevant order to the user.There are many ranking functions like : Pivoted Length Normalization, BM25, Query Likelihood.</p><h4 id="out&#95;of&#95;which&#95;bm25&#95;is&#95;the&#95;most&#95;popular&#95;and&#95;would&#95;discuss&#95;it&#95;here.">Out of which BM25 is the most popular and would discuss it here.</h4><h2 id="bm25&#95;(best&#95;matching&#95;25)">BM25 (Best Matching 25)</h2><p>BM25(Best Matching 25) is a bag of words retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on a query terms appearing in each document.</p><p><font size= "5px">  What is TF* IDF ?  </font></p><p> TF -> TF stands for Term frequency and it states that how often a term occurs in the document? </br>  IDF -> Inversed Document Frequency .THe documents frequency measures how many docs a word appears in.  </br> IDF (1/df) then measures how relevant the term is. Is the term very rare/uncommon? Or very common in the other documents. </br> </br> If the word "football" is very common in a document but very rare in other documents its TF*IDF score will be very high. </br> </br></p><p>The ranking functions would look like : </br> <img src="https://github.com/dhirensr/dhirensr.github.io/blob/master/img/retrieval.png"  title="Text-Retrieval Function" /></p><p> </br>where  </br><pre><code> c&#40;w,q&#41; = count of a word W in a given query q by the user.
 c&#40;w,d&#41;  count of a word W in a document d.
 M+1 - is the total number of documents .
 df&#40;w&#41; - document frequency w.r.t word w.

                                </code></pre></p><h2 id="bm25's&#95;on&#95;term&#95;frequency&#95;(tf&#95;transformation)">BM25's on Term Frequency (TF Transformation)</h2><p> c(w,d) in the ranking function shown above is directly multiplied but what if the word occurs too many times,so suppose if the word w occurs 500 times in a document d,we need to reduce that count as it would not lead to accurate ranking function otherwise. </br> Suppose the user's query Q = news campaign in New York </br> document d1= news about food campaign . Campaign here is great. Did you take part in the food campaign held at New York? he asked. </br> document d2= News campaign is great here .This week in New York on 3rd December. </br> In document d1 the word campaign is occuring many times altough d2 looks more relevant than d1 according to our ranking function d1 would get more rank. </br>Without any consideration for document length, term frequency follows the formula : </br></p><pre><code>&#40;&#40;k + 1&#41; &#42; tf&#41; / &#40;k + tf&#41;
                                </code></pre><p></br>  More TF always means more relevance,however you never get past k, but you always approach it. The k value is often set between 0.9 - 1.2 ,if we set k to a higher value it will again act as a function shown above and create the same problem of TF.</p><h2 id="bm25's&#95;on&#95;document&#95;length&#95;(normalization&#95;of&#95;document&#95;length)">BM25's on Document Length (Normalization of DOcument Length)</h2><p>It can be possible that documents are very much long ,and so the terms in them would occur many times but that doesn't mean that document would always be more relevant.Long documents has always a better chance of matching the user's query. </br> So the document normalizer is used in BM25 is :</p><pre><code>normalizer = 1-b + &#40;b&#42; &#40;|d|/|avdl|&#41;&#41;. where b is between 0 and 1.

                                </code></pre><p></br> so now our ranking function would look like : <img src="https://github.com/dhirensr/dhirensr.github.io/blob/master/img/retrieval.png"  title="Text-Retrieval Function" />  </br></p><p>That's all about BM25 and Text Retrieval .</p><h2 id="suggestions?">Suggestions?</h2><p>If you have any suggestions for a topic or if you think the content is not correct please feel free to contact on github : dhirensr or mail : dhirensr@gmail.com.</p>
